Она показала увеличение метрики F1 на 6%, по сравнению с предыдущей моделью.\n- Затем бы применен метод `upsampling` для увеличения размера выборки для положительного класса.\n- После использования метода upsampling баланс сместился с 80/20 для целевого признака равного 0 и 1 соответственно на 50/50.\n- Увеличение размера выборки позволило увеличить метрику F1 на 1% по сравнению с предыдущей моделью\n\nВ результате проекта получена модель типа \"Случайный лес\", которая предсказывает откажется клиент от услуг банка или нет с метрикой F1 - 0.61 на тестовой выборке.\n\nТакже проведена проверка модели на адекватность с помощью метрики roc_auc_score.
